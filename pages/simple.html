            <h2>Seriously, what else do you want&quest;</h2>
            You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13mb parallax-active homepage is 
            going to get you some real award you can glue to the corner of your site. You think your 40 pound jQuery file and 
            83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box&hyphen;shadow. Wrong!. Let me describe your perfect 
            website&colon;<br>
            <ul>
                <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
                <li>Fits on all your screens</li>
                <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
                <li>It's accessible to everyone that visits your site</li>
                <li>It's legible and gets your point (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters
                    drinking coffee)
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="two"> 
            <h2>Well guess what&quest;</h2>
            You are over&hyphen;designing. Look at this page. It is a website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag
            when i hover it&quest; You spent hours on it and added 80kilobytes to your site, and some jabbing on it on their
            iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit. 
            <br>
            You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.

        <section id="three">
            <h2>It's lightweight</h2>
            This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your wordpress site. Did you seriously 
            load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the background color of a div&quest; You loaded all 7 fontfaces
            of a webfont just so you could say "HI" at 100px height at the begining of your site?
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>It is responsive</h2>
            You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no, Responsive means that it responds to whatever 
            screensize it is viewed on. This site does not care if you are on an iMac or a Tamagotchi.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>It works</h2>
            Look at it, you can read it, that is if you can read lol. It makes sense. It has hierachy. It is using HTML5 tags
            so you and your browser know what is in this site. That is semantics. <br>
            It has content on the screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribble account, but you spread it over 
            7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery scrollTo plugin is. <br>
            Cross-browser compatibility? Load this in IE6. I dare you.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before</h1>
            Like the man who has never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no idea 
            what a website is. All you have seen are extensions of what should be text communicating a message. This is a 
            real website. Look at it. It is beautiful.

        <section>
            <h2>Yes, this is satire</h2>
            I am not actually saying your website should look like this. what I am saying is that all the problems we have 
            with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing 
            and accessible. You break them. <br>

        From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it to 
        today to make your own websites.
